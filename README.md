## 🌟 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to build an **intuitive, accurate, and user-friendly web application** that predicts house prices in **Pune, India**, based on key property features like:

- 📍 Location (Wakad, Hinjewadi, Kothrud, etc.)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms
- 📐 Total Square Footage
- 🏢 BHK Configuration

Using a **pre-trained Linear Regression model**, this tool empowers home buyers, renters, and real estate agents to make data-driven decisions — no guesswork, just predictions grounded in Pune’s real market data.

---

## ✨ Features

✔️ **Real-time Price Prediction** – Input property details → Get instant price estimate  
✔️ **Location-Based Intelligence** – Model trained on Pune-specific housing data  
✔️ **Clean Streamlit UI** – Simple, mobile-friendly, zero learning curve  
✔️ **Data-Driven Insights** – Visualizations of top locations by price (mean & max)  
✔️ **Scalable Architecture** – Easy to retrain with new data or swap models
